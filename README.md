# Dynamic Retail Dashboard
This repository contains a Dynamic Retail Dashboard built using data from three key tables: **Orders**, **People**, and **Returns**. The dashboard provides insightful analyses and critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to aid in understanding retail performance and making informed business decisions.

## **Objective**  
The primary goal of this project is to design an interactive and dynamic dashboard that allows users to:  

- Monitor key metrics such as total sales, profits, and order statistics.  
- Analyze sales trends based on categories, segments, and regions.  
- Use data-driven insights to make informed business decisions.
